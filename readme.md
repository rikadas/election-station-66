## üöÄ Getting Started
Welcome to the election-station-66 project! This application helps volunteers collect the latitude and longitude of election stations across the country. By contributing to this project, you can assist in creating an open database that others can use for building election maps, verifying data, or preparing for elections.

## üìã Project Goals
The main goals of this project include:
- Filling in the `latitude` and `longitude` data in the table.
- Making this data displayable on maps or usable for further analysis.
- Publishing it as **Open Data** under a license that allows everyone to access it for free.

## üìÇ Data Structure
The primary data file is called `station66_distinct_clean.csv`. It contains the following columns:

| Field           | Description                             |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `provinceNumber`| Province code (e.g., 10 = Bangkok)    |
| `province`      | Name of the province                   |
| `registrar_code`| Registrar office code                  |
| `registrar`     | Name of the registrar office           |
| `subdis_code`   | Subdistrict code                       |
| `subdistrict`   | Name of the subdistrict                |
